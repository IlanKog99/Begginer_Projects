# All-In-One Beginner Projects Collection

Welcome to my collection of Python beginner projects! This repository contains several small games and utilities that I created while learning Python. I've decided to refine, refactor, and combine them into a single application to showcase my growth as a programmer.

## What's Inside?

This collection includes:

- **Tic-Tac-Toe**: A classic game of X's and O's with an AI opponent option
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors**: Play against a friend or challenge the computer
- **Number Guessing Game**: Try to guess the random number within a set number of attempts
- **Coin Flip**: A simple coin flipper when you need to make a decision
- **Temperature Converter**: Convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit
- **Simple Calculator**: Perform basic arithmetic operations
- **Dice Roller**: Roll dice with custom number of sides

## About This Project

These were some of my first Python projects, and I wanted to preserve them while also demonstrating how my coding skills have improved. I've refactored the code to be more Pythonic and professional by:

- Implementing proper class structures
- Adding type hints for better readability
- Using constants instead of magic numbers
- Creating more efficient data structures
- Improving error handling
- Following consistent code style

## How to Use

Simply run the main file `AIO_begginer_projects_refined.py` and follow the menu prompts to navigate between different games and utilities. Each game includes its own instructions and is designed to be user-friendly.

## My Learning Journey

This collection represents my journey from writing my first "Hello World" to understanding object-oriented programming concepts. While the applications are simple, they demonstrate fundamental programming concepts like:

- Control flow and logic
- Function and class design
- Data validation
- User input processing
- Basic AI implementation

I hope this collection inspires other beginning programmers to keep refining their skills and to not be afraid of looking back at early code to see how far they've come!

## Feedback

If you have any suggestions or feedback on how I could improve these projects further, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm always looking to learn and grow as a developer!

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
